She also has 4 packs of strawberries, priced at $5 each, and 9 packs of apples, each priced at half the price of a pack of strawberries. If Kelly’s budget is $85 then how much money, in dollars, does she have left in her budget?",
        "answer": "First, find the cost of one pack of bacon by dividing the total cost by the number of packs: $14 / 7 packs = $2/pack\nThen find the cost of one pack of chicken by doubling the cost of a pack of bacon: $2/pack * 2 = $4/pack\nThen multiply the cost of one pack of chicken by the number of packs to find the total cost of the chicken: $4/pack * 8 packs = $32\nThen find the total cost of the strawberries by multiplying the cost per pack by the number of packs: $5/pack * 4 packs = $20\nThen find the cost of one pack of apples by halving the cost of a pack of strawberries: $5/pack / 2 = $2.5/pack\nThen multiply the cost of one pack of apples by the number of packs to find the total cost of the apples: $2.5/pack * 9 packs = $22.5\nThen add the cost of each type of food to find the total cost: $14 + $32 + $20 + $22.5 = $88.5\nThen subtract the total cost from Kelly's budget to find how much she has left: $85 - $88.5 = -$3.5. Since the result is negative, Kelly is over her budget by $3.5.\n\nSo, Kelly does not have any money left in her budget, instead, she is over by $3.5. Therefore, the answer is #### -3.5.",

His backyard fence is rectangular in shape, with the longer side measuring 200 feet and the shorter side measuring 150 feet. Can you calculate how many feet of crepe paper James needs to purchase for his decoration?",
        "answer": "James needs to decorate all four sides of his rectangular backyard fence. The total length of the fence can be calculated by adding up the lengths of all sides. Since a rectangle has two equal longer sides and two equal shorter sides, the total length of the fence is 2*200 + 2*150 = 400 + 300 = 700 feet. \n\nSo, James needs to purchase 700 feet of crepe paper for his decoration. \n\n#### 700 feet",

If the sun starts at the tip of the pyramid and moves for 1000 deciminutes, how many centidegrees will there be from the ground to the sun?",
        "answer": "First, we need to convert the time from deciminutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 1000 deciminutes is 1000/10 = 100 minutes. This is 100/60 = 1.67 hours.\n\nThe sun is moving at 500 centidegrees an hour, so in 1.67 hours it will have moved 500 * 1.67 = 835 centidegrees.\n\nThe sun started at the tip of the pyramid, which is 3200 centidegrees from the ground.

Kayla invited 250 classmates, 70 girls from her dance class, and 130 family members, which totals to 250 + 70 + 130 = <<250+70+130=450>>450 people. \n\nHowever, 40 people said they will not be able to attend, so the actual number of attendees is 450 - 40 = <<450-40=410>>410 people.\n\nThe theater rental fee covers 200 people, so we need to find out how many additional guests there are. This is 410 (total attendees) - 200 (covered by rental fee) = <<410-200=210>>210 additional guests.\n\nThe cost for these additional guests is 210 (additional guests) * $60 (cost per additional guest) = $<<210*60=12600>>12600.\n\nFinally, we add this to the base rental fee of $1250 to find the total cost of the party.

But as she neared the school grounds, she found 80 blue balloons caught in a tree, and she added 75% of them to her remaining clutch of balloons, which she carried into the school. What number of balloons did she finally carry into the school?",
        "answer": "First, let's calculate the total number of balloons Sally initially had. She had 250 red balloons, 70 green balloons, and 120 yellow balloons. So, the total number of balloons she had is 250 + 70 + 120 = 440 balloons.\n\nNext, let's calculate how many balloons burst or were released. 40% of the red balloons burst, which is 40/100 * 250 = 100 balloons. Half of the yellow balloons were released, which is 1/2 * 120 = 60 balloons.\n\nSo, the total number of balloons that burst or were released is 100 + 60 = 160 balloons.\n\nSubtracting the number of balloons that burst or were released from the total number of balloons Sally initially had, we get 440 - 160 = 280 balloons.\n\nFinally, Sally found 80 blue balloons and added 75% of them to her remaining balloons. 75% of 80 balloons is 75/100 * 80 = 60 balloons.\n\nAdding these to the remaining balloons, we get 280 + 60 = #### 340 balloons.

        "answer": "First, we need to calculate how many beads each sister bought.\n\nElizabeth bought 10 packs of red beads and 20 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 200 beads, she bought a total of (10 packs * 200 beads/pack) + (20 packs * 200 beads/pack) = 2000 red beads + 4000 clear beads = 6000 beads.\n\nMargareth bought 30 packs of blue beads and 40 packs of red beads. So, she bought a total of (30 packs * 200 beads/pack) + (40 packs * 200 beads/pack) = 6000 blue beads + 8000 red beads = 14000 beads.\n\nTo find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we subtract the smaller number from the larger one.

He also knows that the packing efficiency is approximately 4/5. He predicts that 3/10 of the jelly beans are red. The actual quantity of red jelly beans in the container is 900. By how much did his estimate deviate from the actual number?",
        "answer": "First, we need to calculate the volume of the container, which is length * width * height = 0.5 feet * 0.5 feet * 1.25 feet = 0.3125 cubic feet.\n\nNext, we calculate how many jelly beans the container can hold by dividing the volume of the container by the volume of a jelly bean. This gives us 0.3125 cubic feet / (1/20) cubic feet/jelly bean = 6250 jelly beans.\n\nHowever, we need to take into account the packing efficiency, which is 4/5. So, the actual number of jelly beans the container can hold is 6250 jelly beans * 4/5 = 5000 jelly beans.\n\nTim predicts that 3/10 of the jelly beans are red, so his estimate for the number of red jelly beans is 5000 jelly beans * 3/10 = 1500 red jelly beans.\n\nThe actual number of red jelly beans is 900, so his estimate deviated from the actual number by 1500 red jelly beans - 900 red jelly beans = #### 600 red jelly beans.",

How many french fries were in the pack when Dave bought it?",
        "answer": "First, let's find out how many fries the seagull ate. The seagull ate half the amount of fries that Dave ate, so he ate 14.0 / 2 = 7.0 fries.\n\nThen, let's find out how many fries the pigeons ate. Each pigeon ate 3.0 fries, so in total they ate 3.0 * 3 = 9.0 fries.\n\nNow, let's find out how many fries were left after the seagull and the pigeons ate. We know that after the ants carried off a final french fry, there were 5.0 fries left. So before the ants came, there were 5.0 + 1.0 = 6.0 fries.\n\nWe also know that the raccoon stole two thirds of the remaining fries.

This is because the final length of the dress (1.4 meters) is made up of the original length, the extension (0.5 times the original length), and the lace trim (0.2 meters). \n\nLet's denote the original length as x. \n\nSo, we have the equation: \n\nx + 0.5x + 0.2 = 1.4 \n\nCombining like terms gives: \n\n1.5x + 0.2 = 1.4 \n\nSubtracting 0.2 from both sides gives: \n\n1.5x = 1.2 \n\nFinally, dividing both sides by 1.5 gives: \n\nx = 1.2 / 1.5 \n\nSo, the original length of the dress was #### 0.8 meters.",

        "answer": "First, find the number of people Mike is still pen pals with by subtracting the number he stopped being pen pals with from the total number: 5.0 people - 2/1 people = 3 people\nThen find the total number of letters Mike writes each week by multiplying the number of letters per person by the number of people: 3 people * 2.0 letters/person = 6 letters\nThen find the total number of pages Mike writes each week by multiplying the number of letters by the number of pages per letter: 6 letters * 5/1 pages/letter = 30 pages\nThen multiply the number of pages by the time per page to find the total time spent writing: 30 pages * 6.0 minutes/page = 180 minutes\nThen divide that number by the number of minutes per hour to convert it to hours: 180 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 3 hours.

She has leftover ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards that cost her $10.00 each. She also has five 4 x 4 x 10 boards she bought for $16.00 each. If she sells them all, how much profit does she make in decimal form?",
        "answer": "First, we need to calculate how much Sasha spent on the lumber. She bought ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards at $10.00 each, which is 10 * $10.00 = $100.00. She also bought five 4 x 4 x 10 boards at $16.00 each, which is 5 * $16.00 = $80.00. So, in total, she spent $100.00 + $80.00 = $180.00.\n\nSince the prices for lumber have gone up by 0.5, she can sell the lumber for 1.5 times the price she bought it for. So, she can sell the lumber for $180.00 * 1.5 = $270.00.\n\nThe profit she makes is the selling price minus the cost price, which is $270.00 - $180.00 = $90.00.\n\nSo, Sasha makes a profit of #### $90.00.",

Her current salary is $100,000. However, she also wants to save an additional $50,000 for an emergency fund, which she plans to accumulate by saving an extra 5% of her salary each year. Considering these additional savings, how many more years does Lauren need to work to meet her retirement and emergency fund goals?",
        "answer": "First, let's calculate how much Lauren saves each year from her salary. She saves 20% of her $100,000 salary, which is $20,000 per year. \n\nNext, let's calculate how much money she needs for her retirement. She wants to live with 40% of her current annual salary for 20 years. So, she needs 40% of $100,000, which is $40,000 per year, for 20 years. This totals to $800,000.\n\nNow, let's calculate how much she needs for her emergency fund. She plans to save an additional 5% of her salary each year, which is $5,000 per year. To accumulate $50,000, she would need to save this amount for 10 years.\n\nSo, to meet both her retirement and emergency fund goals, she needs a total of $800,000 + $50,000 = $850,000.\n\nSince she saves $20,000 per year, she would need to work for $850,000 / $20,000 = 42.5 years. However, since she cannot work for half a year, she would need to work for 43 years to meet her goals.\n\nTherefore, considering these additional savings, Lauren needs to work for 43 - 10 (the years she is already saving for her emergency fund) = #### 33 more years to meet her retirement and emergency fund goals.",

This leaves her with 0.5 hours (3 hours - 2.5 hours = 0.5 hours) to complete the remaining distance.\n\nShe has already walked 6 miles, so she has 6 miles left to walk (12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles).\n\nTo walk 6 miles in 0.5 hours, she needs to walk at a speed of 12 miles per hour (6 miles / 0.5 hours = 12 mph).\n\nSo, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of #### 12 miles per hour.",

        "answer": "First, we need to find the total number of pets. Jennifer has 8 puppies and 6 kittens, which is 14 pets. Brandon has 12 puppies and 10 bunnies, which is 22 pets. So, the total number of pets is 14 + 22 = 36 pets.\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of pets with spots. Jennifer has 3 spotted puppies and 2 spotted kittens, which is 5 spotted pets. Brandon has 4 spotted puppies and 3 spotted bunnies, which is 7 spotted pets. So, the total number of spotted pets is 5 + 7 = 12 spotted pets.\n\nFinally, we need to find the percentage of pets with spots. The formula to find the percentage is (number of spotted pets / total number of pets) * 100. So, (12 / 36) * 100 = 33.33%.\n\nSo, 33.33% of all the pets have spots. \n\n#### 33.33%",

How much money does he save or spend extra by cancelling his $60 cable package and making these changes?",
        "answer": "First, calculate the cost of Hulu and Disney Plus with the discount by multiplying the normal price by 20% and subtracting that amount from the normal price: $10 * 20% = $2. $10 - $2 = $8 each. So, Hulu and Disney Plus together cost $8 * 2 = $16.\n\nNext, calculate the cost of Amazon Prime Video with the student discount by multiplying the normal price by 10% and subtracting that amount from the normal price: $8 * 10% = $0.80. $8 - $0.80 = $7.20.\n\nNow add the cost of all the services together: $10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) + $7.20 (Amazon Prime Video) + $15 (internet upgrade) = $48.20.\n\nFinally, subtract the cost of the new services from the cost of the old cable package to find the difference: $60 - $48.20 = $11.80. \n\nSo, Tim saves $11.80 by cancelling his cable package and subscribing to these services. \n\n#### $11.80.",

        "question": "Sally went to the seashore for vacation. Her parents gave her $20 to buy whatever she wanted. At the trinket shop, taffy was on sale for \"Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off.\" She decided to buy 4 pounds of taffy. She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50 each and decided to buy 2 bags. Additionally, she bought 4 magnets that were $0.25 each and a postcard for $0.75. After buying a bottle of water for $1.25, how much money does Sally have left?",
        "answer": "First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. Since the taffy is \"Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off,\" Sally will pay full price for 2 pounds and half price for 2 pounds. The full price pounds cost 2 * $3 = $6. The half price pounds cost 2 * ($3/2) = $3. So, the total cost of the taffy is $6 + $3 = $9.\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of the seashells. Since each bag of seashells costs $1.50 and Sally bought 2 bags, the total cost of the seashells is 2 * $1.50 = $3.\n\nThe cost of the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.\n\nAdding up the cost of the taffy, seashells, magnets, postcard, and water, we get $9 + $3 + $1 + $0.75 + $1.25 = $15.\n\nFinally, subtracting the total cost of the items from the money Sally started with, we get $20 - $15 = #### 5. So, Sally has $5 left.",

If Tommy sells 43 brownies, 23 slices of cheesecake, and 35 cookies, how much money does Tommy raise? Additionally, if Tommy decides to donate 10% of his total earnings to another charity, how much money will he have left for his own charity?",
        "answer": "Tommy raises $129 from brownies (43 * $3), $92 from cheesecakes (23 * $4), and $70 from cookies (35 * $2). So, Tommy raises a total of $129 + $92 + $70 = $291.\n\nIf Tommy donates 10% of his total earnings to another charity, he will donate $291 * 10/100 = $29.1.\n\nTherefore, Tommy will have $291 - $29.1 = $261.9 left for his own charity. \n\n#### $261.9",

How much money will he be able to earn after selling all his unused land?",
        "answer": "First, let's find out how much land Abraham sold in each transaction.\n\nHe sold half of his land first, which is 80/2 = 40 square meters.\nThen he sold another 1/4 of his land, which is 80/4 = 20 square meters.\n\nSo, he sold 40 + 20 = 60 square meters of land in the first two transactions.\n\nThis means he had 80 - 60 = 20 square meters of land left.\n\nHe divided this remaining land into two equal parts, so each part is 20/2 = 10 square meters.\n\nHe sold one part for $3 per square meter, so he earned 10 * 3 = $30 for this part.\nHe sold the other part for $4 per square meter, so he earned 10 * 4 = $40 for this part.\n\nSo, in total, Abraham earned 50 (from the first transaction) + 30 (from the second transaction) + 30 (from the third transaction) + 40 (from the fourth transaction) = #### 150 dollars.",

However, she also wants to buy a second rope of the same length for her brother, which costs $1.2 a meter. How much money will she have left over after she buys both the new ropes?",
        "answer": "First, we need to find out how much money Sarah will get from selling her rope. She sells it for $2 a meter and the rope is 20 meters long, so she makes 2 * 20 = $<<2*20=40>>40.\n\nNext, we need to find out how much the new ropes will cost. The first rope costs $1.5 a meter and is the same length as the old rope, so it costs 1.5 * 20 = $<<1.5*20=30>>30. The second rope costs $1.2 a meter and is also the same length, so it costs 1.2 * 20 = $<<1.2*20=24>>24.\n\nFinally, we subtract the cost of the new ropes from the money Sarah made from selling her old rope to find out how much money she has left over. She made $40 and the new ropes cost $30 + $24 = $<<30+24=54>>54, so she has 40 - 54 = $<<40-54=-14>>-14 left over. \n\nHowever, since she can't have negative money, this means she doesn't have enough money to buy both ropes and will be short by $14. \n\n####-$14",

        "question": "Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is 40. If the number of coffee mugs is reduced by half after a staff meeting, and then increased by 5 after a delivery, how many coffee mugs are in the teacher’s lounge now?",
        "answer": "First, we need to find out how many coffee mugs were in the teacher's lounge originally. We can do this by setting up the equation 4x + 8 = 40, where x is the number of coffee mugs. Solving for x gives us x = (40 - 8) / 4 = 8.\n\nAfter the staff meeting, the number of coffee mugs is reduced by half, so there are 8 / 2 = 4 mugs left.\n\nAfter a delivery, the number of mugs is increased by 5, so there are now 4 + 5 = 9 mugs in the teacher's lounge.\n\n####9",

The jar has a square base with dimensions of 6 inches by 6 inches and a height of 15 inches. He is aware that a single jelly bean occupies a space of .15 cubic inches. He also knows that the packing efficiency is approximately 80%. He estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red. However, he also knows that the jar is not completely filled and is only 95% full. The actual number of red jelly beans in the container is 900. How far off was his guess considering the jar's fill percentage?",
        "answer": "First, we need to calculate the volume of the jar. The volume of a square-based prism (like our jar) is given by the formula V = a^2 * h, where a is the length of the side of the base and h is the height. So, the volume of the jar is V = 6*6 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.\n\nSince the jar is only 95% full, the volume occupied by the jelly beans is 0.95 * 540 = 513 cubic inches.\n\nThe packing efficiency tells us that only 80% of this volume is actually occupied by jelly beans, so the volume occupied by the jelly beans is 0.8 * 513 = 410.4 cubic inches.\n\nSince each jelly bean occupies a space of .15 cubic inches, the total number of jelly beans in the jar is 410.4 / .15 = 2736 jelly beans.\n\nTim estimates that 30% of these are red, so his guess for the number of red jelly beans is 0.3 * 2736 = 820.8, which we'll round to 821.\n\nThe actual number of red jelly beans is 900, so Tim's guess was off by 900 - 821 = 79.\n\nSo, Tim's guess was off by #### 79 jelly beans.",

        "answer": "First, we need to calculate the total amount Sheila returned. This is $15.00 + $10.00 = $25.00.\n\nNext, we subtract this amount from the initial charge on her credit card.

After that, he stops on an island and rests for the same amount of time as the swimming time. He then finishes the remaining distance while going a third of the speed. After reaching the other side, he realizes he left something on the island and swims back to the island at his original speed, retrieves his item, and then swims back to the other side of the lake at half his original speed. How long did it take him to complete all these tasks?",
        "answer": "First, let's calculate the time it takes for James to swim half the distance of the lake. The lake is 30 miles, so half the distance is 15 miles. At a speed of 3 miles per hour, it would take him 15 miles / 3 mph = 5 hours.\n\nHe then rests for the same amount of time, so that's another 5 hours.\n\nNext, he swims the remaining distance at a third of his original speed, which is 3 mph / 3 = 1 mph. So, it would take him 15 miles / 1 mph = 15 hours to swim the remaining distance.\n\nAfter reaching the other side, he swims back to the island at his original speed, which is 3 mph. The distance to the island is half the lake, so it's 15 miles. It would take him 15 miles / 3 mph = 5 hours to swim back to the island.\n\nFinally, he swims back to the other side of the lake at half his original speed, which is 3 mph / 2 = 1.5 mph. It would take him 15 miles / 1.5 mph = 10 hours to swim back to the other side.\n\nAdding up all these times, we get 5 hours (first half of the swim) + 5 hours (rest) + 15 hours (second half of the swim) + 5 hours (swim back to the island) + 10 hours (final swim back to the other side) = #### 40 hours.",

However, Frederick also needs to consider the cost of the saw blade. Each saw blade costs $2 and can cut enough wood for 1000 sticks before it needs to be replaced. What is the most popsicle sticks he can make if he buys the cheapest lumber and takes into account the cost of the saw blades?",
        "answer": "First, we need to determine which piece of wood gives more sticks per dollar. \n\nA 2 x 4 piece of wood costs $4 and gives 200 sticks, so it gives 200/4 = 50 sticks per dollar.\n\nA 2 x 8 piece of wood costs $6 and gives 400 sticks, so it gives 400/6 = 66.67 sticks per dollar.\n\nSo, the 2 x 8 piece of wood is cheaper per stick.\n\nNext, we need to consider the cost of the saw blades. Each saw blade costs $2 and can cut enough wood for 1000 sticks. So, the cost per stick for the saw blade is 2/1000 = $0.002.\n\nNow, we need to subtract the cost of the saw blades from the $24 Frederick has. \n\n$24 - $0.002 per stick = $24 - $0.002*1000 sticks = $24 - $2 = $22.\n\nNow, Frederick has $22 to spend on 2 x 8 pieces of wood. Each 2 x 8 piece of wood costs $6, so he can buy 22/6 = 3.67 pieces of wood. Since he can't buy a fraction of a piece of wood, he can buy 3 pieces of wood.\n\nEach 2 x 8 piece of wood gives 400 sticks, so 3 pieces of wood give 3*400 = 1200 sticks.\n\nSo, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make if he buys the cheapest lumber and takes into account the cost of the saw blades is #### 1200.",

Each child decides to have half a bowl more, adding 1 child bowl in total. So, they will now consume 2 (Calvin and wife) + 1 (friend) + 2 (children) + 1 (extra for children) = 6 adult bowls of soup, which is equivalent to 12 child bowls. The pot contains enough soup for 8 child bowls, so there will be 8 - 12 = -4 child bowls of soup left. \n\nSince the leftover soup is negative, it means there won't be any soup left for the children to have for lunch.

If Carly gives the cashier two twenty-dollar bills and one ten-dollar bill, how much change does she get back?",
        "answer": "First, let's calculate the total cost of each item:\n\n- The hamburgers cost 5 * $4 = $<<5*4=20>>20.\n- The potato fries cost 10 * $0.30 = $<<10*0.30=3>>3.\n- The fruit drinks cost 5 * $2 = $<<5*2=10>>10.\n- The cookies cost 3 * $1.50 = $<<3*1.50=4.5>>4.5.\n- The water bottles cost 2 * $1 = $<<2*1=2>>2.\n\nSo, the total cost of all items is $20 + $3 + $10 + $4.5 + $2 = $<<20+3+10+4.5+2=39.5>>39.5.\n\nCarly gives the cashier $20 + $20 + $10 = $<<20+20+10=50>>50.\n\nTherefore, the change Carly gets back is $50 - $39.5 = #### 10.5.",

If the prices remain the same, how much will she spend on dry-cleaning in 10 weeks?",
        "answer": "First, let's calculate how much Alicia spends on dry-cleaning in one week. She spends $5.00 per blouse, $6.00 per skirt, and $8.00 per pair of pants. So, the total cost for one week is:\n\n5 blouses * $5.00/blouse + 2 pants * $8.00/pants + 1 skirt * $6.00/skirt = $25.00 + $16.00 + $6.00 = $47.00\n\nNext, let's calculate how much she spends in 10 weeks, considering the extra pair of pants every second week and an extra skirt every third week. \n\nIn 10 weeks, there are 5 \"second\" weeks and 3 \"third\" weeks. So, the extra cost for the pants is 5 weeks * $8.00/week = $40.00, and the extra cost for the skirts is 3 weeks * $6.00/week = $18.00.\n\nSo, the total cost for 10 weeks is 10 weeks * $47.00/week + $40.00 + $18.00 = $470.00 + $40.00 + $18.00 = $528.00.\n\nSo, Alicia spends #### 528.00 in 10 weeks.",

Considering that Tim also wants to make a half gallon of lemonade for himself that is three times as tart as the regular recipe, how many lemons will Tim need in total?",
        "answer": "For the pool party, Tim needs 4 gallons of lemonade. Since 1 gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice, and 1 cup of juice comes from 6 lemons, he needs 4*6 = 24 lemons for the pool party.\n\nFor Allen, he needs to make the lemonade twice as tart, so he needs twice the amount of lemon juice. That means he needs 2*6 = 12 lemons for Allen's lemonade.\n\nFor his sister, he needs to make the lemonade half as tart, so he needs half the amount of lemon juice. Since she wants a half gallon, he needs 0.5*0.5*6 = 1.5 lemons for his sister's lemonade.\n\nFor himself, he wants the lemonade three times as tart, so he needs three times the amount of lemon juice. Since he wants a half gallon, he needs 0.5*3*6 = 9 lemons for his own lemonade.\n\nAdding all these up, Tim needs 24 + 12 + 1.5 + 9 = 46.5 lemons.

After reaching his friend's house, he decides to visit another friend who lives 30 miles away before heading home. He drives to his second friend's house at a speed of 60 mph. After visiting his second friend, he takes a route home that is 240 miles but he goes 80 mph. How long did the entire trip take?",
        "answer": "First, we need to find out how long each leg of the trip took. \n\nFor the first leg, John drove 210 miles (200 miles to his friend's house plus the 10-mile detour) at 70 mph. To find the time, we divide the distance by the speed: 210 miles ÷ 70 mph = 3 hours.\n\nFor the second leg, John drove 30 miles at 60 mph. Again, we divide the distance by the speed: 30 miles ÷ 60 mph = 0.5 hours.\n\nFor the third leg, John drove 240 miles at 80 mph. We divide the distance by the speed: 240 miles ÷ 80 mph = 3 hours.\n\nTo find the total time for the trip, we add up the time for each leg: 3 hours + 0.5 hours + 3 hours = 6.5 hours.\n\nSo, the entire trip took John 6.5 hours. \n\n#### 6.5 hours",

        "answer": "On the first day, Julie sold 14 glasses and the boys sold 32 - 14 = 18 glasses together. Since the boys sold an equal number of glasses, Micah sold 18 / 2 = 9 glasses on the first day.\n\nOn the second day, they sold twice as many glasses as they did on the first day, which is 2 * 32 = 64 glasses. Julie sold the same number of glasses as she did on the first day, which is 14 glasses. The boys sold 64 - 14 = 50 glasses together. Since the boys sold an equal number of glasses, Micah sold 50 / 2 = 25 glasses on the second day.\n\nSo, Micah sold 9 + 25 = 34 glasses over the two days.\n\nJulie sold 14 glasses on each day, so she sold 14 * 2 = 28 glasses over the two days.\n\nTherefore, Julie sold 28 - 34 = -6 glasses less than Micah over the two days.

        "answer": "First, Sophia gave Jack 1/5 of her $200, which is $200 x 1/5 = $<<200*1/5=40>>40.\nSo, Jack now has $100 + $40 = $<<100+40=140>>140.\nAfter giving Jack $40, Sophia had $200 - $40 = $<<200-40=160>>160 left.\nShe spent 1/4 of her remaining money on a dress, which is $160 x 1/4 = $<<160*1/4=40>>40.\nSo, Sophia had $160 - $40 = $<<160-40=120>>120 left.\nThen, she gave half of what was left to Jack, which is $120 / 2 = $<<120/2=60>>60.\nTherefore, Jack now has $140 + $60 = $<<140+60=200>>200.

If his car payment is $500 and he spends $50 on fuel each time he rents out his car, how much profit does he make on his car in a month?",
        "answer": "First, calculate how much John earns from renting out his car by multiplying the number of times he rents it out by the number of hours each rental lasts and the hourly rate: 10 rentals * 3 hours/rental * $25/hour = $750.\n\nThen calculate how much John spends on fuel by multiplying the number of times he rents out his car by the cost of fuel each time: 10 rentals * $50/rental = $500.\n\nNow add up all of John's costs: $500 for the car payment, $500 for fuel, and $100 for maintenance for a total of $500 + $500 + $100 = $1100.\n\nFinally, subtract John's costs from his earnings to find his profit: $750 - $1100 = -$350. \n\nSo, John is not making a profit, but rather, he is losing money.

Considering these additional costs and the depreciation, find the total amount of money Ben will lose if he sells the car in 2010.",
        "answer": "The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year for 3 years (from 2007 to 2010). \n\nThe depreciation for the first year is 21% of $20000, which is $20000 * 0.21 = $4200.

        "answer": "To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the final value of the boat. \n\nFirst, we find the value of the boat before the third year's depreciation. Since the boat depreciated 20% in the third year, the value of the boat before this depreciation is $9000 / (1 - 0.20) = $11250.\n\nNext, we find the value of the boat before the second year's depreciation. Since the boat depreciated 30% in the second year, the value of the boat before this depreciation is $11250 / (1 - 0.30) = $16071.43.\n\nFinally, we find the original value of the boat before the first year's depreciation. Since the boat depreciated 30% in the first year, the original value of the boat is $16071.43 / (1 - 0.30) = $22959.19.\n\nSo, Gary originally bought the boat for approximately $22959.19.\n\n#### $22959.19",

        "answer": "First, we need to find out how much Antonella earned from the 30% commission. We know that 30% of $1000 is $300.

        "answer": "Let's denote the initial number of people on the train as X.\n\nAt the first stop, 20 more people board the train, so the number of people becomes X + 20.\n\nAt the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, so the number of people becomes X + 20 - 50 = X - 30. However, twice the number of people that descended (50 * 2 = 100) board the train, so the number of people becomes X - 30 + 100 = X + 70.\n\nAt the third station, 80 more people descend, so the number of people becomes X + 70 - 80 = X - 10.\n\nWe know that the total number of people on the train at the final stop is 120, so we can set up the equation X - 10 = 110.\n\nSolving for X gives X = 110 + 10 = 120.\n\nSo, the number of people on the train when Romeo initially boarded was 120. \n\n####120",

On the sidewalk, Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed that she does on the beach. If it takes her 60 minutes to complete the entire 3-mile walk, how long does she spend walking on the beach, in minutes?",
        "answer": "Let's denote the speed on the beach as v (in miles per hour) and the speed on the sidewalk as 2v (since it's twice as fast). \n\nThe total time spent walking is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk. We know that time is equal to distance divided by speed, so we can set up the following equation:\n\n2/v (time on the beach) + 1/(2v) (time on the sidewalk) = 1 hour (since 60 minutes is 1 hour)\n\nMultiplying through by 2v to clear the denominators gives:\n\n4 (time on the beach in hours) + 1 (time on the sidewalk in hours) = 2v\n\nSince we know that the total time is 1 hour, we can substitute this into the equation to solve for v:\n\n4 (time on the beach in hours) + 1 (time on the sidewalk in hours) = 2\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n4 (time on the beach in hours) = 1\n\nSo, the time on the beach in hours is 1/4, or 0.25 hours. \n\nTo convert this to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour), giving:\n\n0.25 * 60 = 15 minutes\n\nSo, Grandma spends #### 15 minutes walking on the beach.",

        "answer": "First find how many gallons of water flow out of the pools in 4 minutes: 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = <<4*4=16>>16 gallons\nLet b be the amount of water the big pool has now and s be the amount of water the small pool has. We know that b = 4s, and b + 16 = 2(s + 16)\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 4s + 16 = 2(s + 16)\nMultiplying through the parentheses, we get 4s + 16 = 2s + 32\nSubtracting 2s from both sides, we get 2s + 16 = 32\nSubtracting 16 from both sides, we get 2s = 16\nDividing both sides by 2, we get s = <<8=8>>8\n#### 8",

        "answer": "If the combined age of the children is 20, the average age of the group is 20 years / 4 = <<20/4=5>>5 years.\nHelene is twice as old as the group's average age, meaning Helene is 2 * 5 years = <<2*5=10>>10 years old.\nThe total age of the three children is 10 years + 3 years + 4 years = <<10+3+4=17>>17 years.\nWilfred's age is 20 years - 17 years = <<20-17=3>>3 years.\n#### 3",

How much does Brady have in his piggy bank in dollars, disregarding the movie tickets?",
        "answer": "Since a penny is 1 cent, then 100 pennies is equal to 100 x 1 cent = <<100=100>>100 cents.\nSince nickel is 5 cents, then 40 nickels is equal to 40 x 5 = <<40*5=200>>200 cents.\nSince a dime is equal to 10 cents, then 20 dimes are equal to 20 x 10 = <<20*10=200>>200 cents.\nSo, Brady has a total of 100 + 200 + 200 = <<100+200+200=500>>500 cents.\nSince a dollar is equal to 100 cents, then 500 cents is equal to 500/100 = <<500/100=5>>5 dollars.\nThus, Brady has a total of $40 + $5 = $<<40+5=45>>45 in his piggy bank.\n#### 45",

        "question": "Marcus is trying to decide whether he really needs to do his homework. There's a 50% chance that tomorrow he'll have a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework. Even if the normal teacher comes in, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. Even if the whole class doesn't get an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. On top of all this, Marcus has a 30% chance of winning a lottery ticket that he bought, which would make him so happy that he wouldn't care about the homework, but this won't affect whether or not he has to turn it in. What is the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow?",
        "answer": "First find the chance that the normal teacher comes in by subtracting the odds she doesn't from 100%: 100% - 50% = 50%\nThen find the chance the teacher doesn't grant the whole class an extension by subtracting the chance she does from 100%: 100% - 40% = 60%\nThen find the chance that Marcus can't get a personal extension by subtracting the chance he does from 100%: 100% - 20% = 80%\nNow find the chance the teacher comes in AND doesn't grant the whole class an extension by multiplying the two independent probabilities: .6 * .5 = <<.6*.5=.3>>.3\nNow multiply that probability by the probability Marcus can't get a personal extension to find the probability he actually has to turn in his homework: .3 * .8 = <<.3*.8=.24>>.24\nFinally, multiply the decimal probability by 100 to express it as a percentage: .24 * 100% = <<.24*100=24>>24%\n#### 24",

        "question": "Nick is choosing between two jobs. Job A pays $15 an hour for 2000 hours a year, and is in a state with a 20% total tax rate. Job A provides with 1 computer for free. Job B pays $42,000 a year and is in a state that charges $6,000 in property tax and a 10% tax rate on net income after property tax. How much more money will Nick make at the job with a higher net pay rate, compared to the other job?",
        "answer": "First calculate the gross annual salary for Job A: 2000 hours * $15/hour = $<<2000*15=30000>>30,000\nNext, calculate the amount of taxes Nick pays at Job A by multiplying his net salary by the 20% tax rate: .2 * $30,000 = $<<30000*.2=6000>>6,000\nNow subtract Nick's taxes from his net pay to find his gross pay at Job A: $30,000 - $6,000 = $<<30000-6000=24000>>24,000\nNow subtract Nick's property taxes from his gross income at Job B: $42,000 - $6,000 = $<<42000-6000=36000>>36,000\nNow multiply Nick's income after property tax by 10% to find his income tax at Job B: $36,000 * 10% = $<<36000*10*.01=3600>>3,600\nNow subtract the income tax amount from Nick's earnings after property tax to find his net income at Job B: $36,000 - $3,600 = $<<36000-3600=32400>>32,400\nNow subtract the net income from the lower-paying job (A) from the net income from the higher-paying job (B): $32,400 - $24,000 = $<<32400-24000=8400>>8,400\n#### 8400",
